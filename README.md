# karstimer

A Flutter App to do lap timing for auto racing. 

## Getting Started

This app uses the smartphone GPS to record lap times 
during a practice run or a race. 

Right now, laps can be marked manually. A function to use GPS to detect
crossing the starting line is still To Be Developed.

A map display of recorded positions, speeds, and timestamps is available.

There is no saving to disk or cloud yet.
