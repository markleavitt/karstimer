A simple GPS-based lap timer for motorsports. 
My first Flutter app! Written in Dart.

## Getting Started

There are four screens (tabs):
* Timer screen: has start/stop button, lap marker button, and displays current, last, and best lap times.
* Lap log: displays laps and lap times
* Map: displays track positions on a map; click on a position n for speed/ET within lap; allows selection of which lap to display
* Setup: many options, including clearing and erasing race data, saving race data to smartphone memory, turning automatic GPS-based lap marking on/off, activating a GPS simulator for testing without driving around, more...

When installing, you must grant the app location permission.
